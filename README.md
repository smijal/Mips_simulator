# Mips_simulator

Group project (sorry for the complex code. This was our first project ever using Python, and the whole group was using different commands without any previous knowledge). I cannot edit certain parts of the code because I worked in a group.
I have a permission to share it.

Simulating MIPS processor and cache. 
Supports many MIPS assembly instructions. Simulates single cycle MIPS, multicycle and pipelined.
Supports different cache configurations.
Supports debug mode (line by line execution).

NOTE: To test different instructions, edit the assembly code in one of the .asm files.
